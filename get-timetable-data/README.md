# Script to scrap timetables from the Website of the University of Bremerhaven

This script is no longer in usage, but it serves as an example on how to get the timetable information.
We now use several functions in our Webapplication to get these information.

## Install modules

```bash
get-timetable-data~$ bash install.sh
```

## Example

```bash
get-timetable-data~$ python3 get_timetable_data.py -cw 42
```
